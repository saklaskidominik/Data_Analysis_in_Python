## Project Overview

### Holocene Volcanism

Analysis of global volcanic activity during the Holocene epoch based on open datasets.

**Used packages:**
- **pandas** – data loading and preparation
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn** – creating plots (e.g., eruption distribution over time, bar and pie charts)
- **numpy** – numerical operations
- **datetime** – working with dates

**Example tasks:**
- Data cleaning
- Analysis of eruption numbers across millennia
- Identification of the most active regions

### GDP Changes During the 2008–2009 Global Financial Crisis

Study of GDP dynamics in selected countries during the financial crisis.

**Used packages:**
- **pandas** – time series processing
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn** – GDP change visualization
- **numpy** – statistical calculations
- **scipy** – simple statistical analysis

**Example tasks:**
- Comparing GDP drops
- Detecting trends and anomalies
- Visualization of economic data

### Bicycle Traffic on the Fremont Bridge in Seattle

Analysis of bicycle traffic data from automatic counters.

**Used packages:**
- **pandas** – data manipulation and time grouping
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn** – daily, weekly, and seasonal visualizations
- **datetime** – date conversion and extraction

**Example tasks:**
- Peak hour identification
- Trend analysis in selected seasons
- Aggregations by day of the week

### Spatial Data Analysis

Projects exploring geospatial data (e.g., event distribution, point analysis, map generation).

**Used packages:**
- **geopandas** – reading and analyzing vector data (shapefile, GeoJSON)
- **shapely** – geometry operations (e.g., buffers, intersections)
- **matplotlib** – map visualizations
- **contextily** – basemap tiles
- **pandas**, **numpy** – data preparation and integration

**Example tasks:**
- Creating point maps
- Defining buffer zones
- Spatial cluster analysis
